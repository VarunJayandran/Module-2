# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
Assign the value 16 to a variable a.
Use the built-in bin() function to convert the number to binary.
Print the result.
## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a=16
print(bin(a))

```
## Output

![442780075-3d90ea4f-689b-4e69-ad4e-5a91716980a0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75b044b4-4e9e-4102-8500-8906dfa29556)
